# Definition of an attribute

An attribute is a productâ€™s characteristic. Each product is composed of different attributes.

Depending on your Akeneo Edition version, you can have up to 15 attribute types:
- identifier: a unique code that identifies your product
- text and text area: used for text data
- simple or multi select
- reference data (simple and multi select)
- boolean (yes/no)
- date
- number
- price
- metric (with automatic conversions)
- media file: a simple file (pdf file for instance) or an image
- [assets](/articles/work-with-assets.html): digital resources like a video, picture, pdf file... _(Entreprise Edition only)_

Attributes are gathered into [attribute groups](/articles/what-is-an-attribute-group.html) in Akeneo.

:::info
The only mandatory attribute is the **Identifier attribute type**. You first need to create an identifier attribute type before creating products.
:::

:::warning
You can only have one **identifier attribute type** in your PIM.
:::

:::warning
A **text** attribute is **limited to 255 characters**, for text data greater than 255 char, use the **text area** attribute type.

# Attribute properties
An attribute can have several specific properties: it can be localizable, locale specific and/or scopable.

::: info
You can mix and match attribute properties to achieve a powerful result.
:::

## _Localisable_ attribute

A localisable attribute can have different values per locale.  
This allows you to manage a product translations according to the activated PIM locales.  

For instance, a localisable attribute will enable you to have one product name for each locale activated in your PIM. It is mostly used for text or (simple or multi) select attributes.

## _Locale specific_ attribute

Some attributes can be shown only for specific locales. We will call them locale specific.

For instance, a cold resistance attribute for Russia, a Canadian tax only for Canada.

## _Scopable_ attribute

Finally, an attribute can be scopable. An attribute is scopable if its values differ for each channel.

For instance, you might want:
- a short description for your e-commerce website
- a even shorter for your mobile app
- a long one for your print catalog

# Validation parameters

In order to control your data quality, you can add validation parameters to some of your attributes. 

To discover the validation parameters for each attribute types, check our dedicated article: [validation for the different attribute types](/articles/manage-your-attributes.html#validation-for-the-different-attribute-types)

For instance, you can add a regular expression on a text field to use it for EAN codes. As they contain 13 digits, we can add a validation rule based on the following regular expression: `/^[0-9]{13}$/`
